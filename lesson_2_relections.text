When I initialize a directory it creates a .git file, which
includes metadata used to track the repository.

The staging area is different from the working directory
because it allows me to perform git commands before
deciding whether or not to make a commit. The staging
area is also different from a repository because I can
decide which files to include or exclude from a commit.
