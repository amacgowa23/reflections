I would use a remote repository rather than keeping all my work local when performing changes from multiple computers, or when working on a joint project with other people.

I would want to always pull changes manually from GitHub rather
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with my remote
repository because I want to be able to pick and choose changes
that are made to my public GitHub repository to be incorporated 
into my local repository.

A fork is basically a clone on GitHub. It allows me to create a clone from an existing branch. The branch could be mine or someone else's. A 
clone is an identical repository created on my local computer in Git. A 
branch is a label for one or more commits.
