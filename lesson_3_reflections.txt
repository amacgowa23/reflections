I would use a remote repository rather than keeping all my work local when performing changes from multiple computers, or when working on a joint project with other people.

I would want to always pull changes manually from GitHub rather
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with my remote
repository because I want to be able to pick and choose changes
that are made to my public GitHub repository to be incorporated 
into my local repository.
